With the Artemis program, humans will soon return to explore the Moon. However, lunar surface dust has toxic potential that must be assessed in order to clarify short-term and long-term health risks for Artemis astronauts. Numerous studies indicate that Moon dust has chemical and physical properties that may strongly affect dust toxicity. Unlike terrestrial dust, lunar regolith experiences “space weathering” under a vacuum, including the effects of solar wind, which further modifies the bulk and surface properties of this dust. In this work, we used two lunar dust simulant materials that were chemically treated to mimic the effects of space weathering. This treatment strongly increased all the toxic effects of both simulants: cell killing, mitochondrial dysfunction, and damage to DNA. Other experiments point to free radicals as a significant component of these effects. Future work will address whether these radicals arise from the simulants themselves or are generated by cellular activity.
